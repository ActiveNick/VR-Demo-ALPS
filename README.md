# VR-Demo-ALPS
Basic mobile Virtual Reality demo for Android, iOS  &amp; Windows Phone 8.1 using the [ALPS-VR](https://github.com/Foxman13/ALPS-VR) SDK, used in my [talks on Virtual &amp; Mixed Reality](http://www.slideshare.net/ActiveNick/from-oculus-to-hololens-building-virtual-mixed-reality-apps-games). Built in Unity 5.3.

**Note:** It appears that the ALPS-VR open source SDK is not longer being maintained, with no updates in about 2 years. I still included this demo in some of my presentations due to its cross-platform nature that includes Windows Phone 8.1 in addition to iOS & Android. That said, I now recommend building mobile VR projects in Unity using the [VISR-VR SDK](https://github.com/ActiveNick/VR-Demo-VISR) which is still actively being developed, and supports Windows 10 UWP.

**Devices tested so far:**
* Lumia Lumia 950 XL
* Google Nexus 6

This demo is based on the ALPS-VR demo from the [Microsoft Virtual Academy](http://mva.microsoft.com/) course "[Creating Virtual and Augmented Reality Apps on the Windows Platform](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/creating-virtual-and-augmented-reality-apps-on-the-windows-platform-16141?l=E69QrDSGC_8905192797)"
